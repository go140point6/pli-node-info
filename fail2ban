Configure fail2ban
(https://pimylifeup.com/raspberry-pi-fail2ban/)

  ```
  sudo cp -p /etc/fail2ban/jail.conf /etc/fail2ban/jail.local
  sudo vim /etc/fail2ban/jail.local
  ```

Find the sshd section (scroll down a bit).  Default is just enable through port... replace those three lines with all these:

enabled   = true
filter    = sshd
port      = ssh
banaction = iptables-multiport
findtime  = 86400 # 86400 seconds = 1 day
bantime   = -1
maxretry  = 3
logpath = %(sshd_log)s
backend = %(sshd_backend)s

  ```sudo systemctl restart fail2ban```

check who's banned:
  ```
  sudo fail2ban-client status sshd
  ```
unban ip:
  ```
  sudo fail2ban-client set sshd unban {ip address}
  ```
