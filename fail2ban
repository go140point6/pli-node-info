Configure fail2ban
(https://pimylifeup.com/raspberry-pi-fail2ban/)

  sudo cp -p /etc/fail2ban/jail.conf /etc/fail2ban/jail.local
  sudo vim /etc/fail2ban/jail.local
Note -> or your editor of choice, i.e. nano

Find the sshd section (scroll down a bit).  Default is just enable through port... replace those three lines with all these:

enabled   = true
filter    = sshd
port      = ssh
banaction = iptables-multiport
findtime  = 86400 # 86400 seconds = 1 day
bantime   = -1 # -1 = ban forever
maxretry  = 3 # 3 attempts in 1 day = ban
logpath = %(sshd_log)s
backend = %(sshd_backend)s

  sudo systemctl restart fail2ban

check who's banned:
  sudo fail2ban-client status sshd
unban ip:
  sudo fail2ban-client set sshd unban {ip address}
  
  Note: you can and probably will ban your own IP at some point if you mistype your password to many times (you should be using keys tho,
  so that doesn't happen).  There is a section near the top that you can exempt your own IP address or you could raise the maxretry number
  to something higher.  If you DO ban yourself, log in to your VPS through the hoster's console and unban your IP (the IP from the system you are
  attepmting to access your VPS, i.e. your home network IP).
