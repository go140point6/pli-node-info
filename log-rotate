The following procedure will keep the logs from getting to big by rotating them daily, 
and compressing old logs to save space.  After 10 days, the old logs are deleted.

Logrotate is a system util that should be installed by default on Ubuntu 20.04 but if 
you need to install it:
    
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install logrotate

    logrotate --version # verify logrotate is installed
    
Create new file in the /etc/logrotate.d/ directory, calling it whatever you want:

    sudo nano /etc/logrotate.d/plugin-logs

Add the following to the file and save:

    /home/jojo/.pm2/logs/*.log
    /home/jojo/.plugin/*.jsonl
    /home/jojo/.cache/*.logf
    {
            su jojo jojo
            rotate 10
            copytruncate
            daily
            missingok
            notifempty
            compress
            delaycompress
            sharedscripts
            postrotate
                    invoke-rc.d rsyslog rotate >/dev/null 2>&1 || true
            endscript
    }
    
Note: jojo is my user and you must specify the path to your logs that you want to rotate.  
The asterisk (*) is a wildcard that will include anything, so in this case any file that 
ends in .log will be rotated.  Add multiple directories as shown, feel free to add any
others that may be needed.

If using root you likely don't need the su (switch user) part but it won't hurt.  Just
replace jojo with root for both user and group.  Your path is likely /root/.pm2/logs/*.log

What is going to happen?  Every night logroate will look in those diretories, rotate the 
current log, compress the old log and delete the really old files, ensuring your logs don't
get out of control.  I do 10 days, but you can make the rotate option a bigger number if you
want to retain more logs.
